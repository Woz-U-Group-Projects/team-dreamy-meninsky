Technology Used:
- Front End: Angular
- Back End: Java - Spring
- Database: NoSQL

Initial Features:
- A user will be able to post photos and information as per other social media outlets.
- Add friends to their social media platform in order to create their own community.
- Receive comments and posts of friends in order to engage in a communal setting.  (conversations etc.)
- Tags will be allowed for the ability acknowledge other users.
- A reviewer (or commenter) can search by tags to engage in similar modes of discussion or to link up with other users
- A user will be able to create an account with minimal information (email, name, dob)
- Soruce Control: Github

Deployment: Amazon Webservice

How does this meet the requirements:

NoSQL will hold user information, project information, and comments.
Java - Spring will assist with user registration, authentication, and allow for the data from the database to be exposed through an API.
Angular will be the primary user interface for users, and will allow them to navigate to sections based on authentication. It will be necessary to work with ionic to bridge the gap for mobile usage as well (it maybe necessary to incorporate other frameworks, but we will just have to see).
